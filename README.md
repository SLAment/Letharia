# Scripts and pipelines used in the *Letharia* study of the Johannesson's Lab

All scripts related to genome annotation of the genus Letharia, designed to be run in UPPMAX (Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science) as part of the lichen projects in Johannesson Lab (Uppsala University). However, the Snakemake pipeline should work also in other Unix environments.
