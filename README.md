# Scripts and pipelines used in the *Letharia* study of the Johannesson's Lab

Here you'll find the scripts and pipelines associated to the study [Ament-Vel√°squez, S. L., Tuovinen, et al. (2020). The plot thickens: Haploid and triploid-like thalli, hybridization, and biased mating type ratios in Letharia. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.423428v1). 

There are two main folders:

- **MAT annotation:** gene annotation of the MAT locus of the genus *Letharia*, designed to run in UPPMAX (Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science).
- **Lichen Ploidy:** a Snakemake pipeline to infer the ploidy (*sensu lato*, since it would include heterokaryosis) from a (meta)genome, as well as additional analysis to show that the triploid-like samples look like hybrids.
